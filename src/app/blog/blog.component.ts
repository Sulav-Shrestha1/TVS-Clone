TVS believes in keeping up with the advancing technology and times and is now proud to be the first in the 2 wheeler industry in Nepal  to introduce a smarter riding experience with SmartXconnect a cutting-edge technology that takes riding experience to a whole new level.', p2: 'SmartXConnect feature is a Bluetooth enabled system that offers unique defined insights to riders. It is versatile and offers a wide variety of utility as well as racing services such as race telemetry, lean angle mode, navigation assist and so much more.', strong1: 'Navigation Assist', p3: 'Getting to our destinations has become much easier these days, as we use our phones and navigate our way through the streets. However, most of us still rely on our smartphones or smart watches which can be inconvenient and dangerous whilst riding. With TVS Smartconnect this changes, as the inbuilt  navigation system shows you precise location on your rides console itself. The digital console guides you for an easy navigating experience. This ensures that the rider’s attention remains on the road. There are two modes available for navigation. The trip mode is for short rides and the system saves the trip details after the bike ignition is switched off. The tour mode on the other hand, allows the rider to choose the destination and navigate accordingly.', strong2: 'Last parked location', p4: 'It can be tricky to remember the exact location of your rides at times. This useful feature will save the last parked location on the app once the vehicle is parked at a place. The user can check the location of their vehicle on the map with the app and it helps the rider to find their vehicle with ease.', strong3: 'Caller ID', p5: 'Another super useful feature on the TVS SmartxConnect is the Caller ID which is designed for the safety and comfort of the riders. Receiving an incoming call while you are riding can be haselous. The Caller ID function allows the rider to see the ID of the caller on the screen itself. This prevents the riders from getting distressed about the incoming call or distracted by it. Another feature in this is the smart reply function which automatically sends a reply to the caller, letting them know that the latter is riding.',strong4: 'Lean Angle mode', p6: 'The new TVS rides use the gyroscopic sensor on the phone to record the rider’s lean angle at the corners. The level is displayed on the racing console whereas the app records the in-depth angle of lean through a lap. It ensures that the racer knows the absolute limit at every corner and keeps them safe for a fun riding experience.', strong5: 'Multiple Stop Plotting', p7: 'When the riders are navigating with the tour mode, this SmartxConnect feature allows the riders to plot multiple locations in between their ride/tour. When the rider is out for a long tour, they can use this feature to plot certain landmarks or viewpoints. The feature even allows the bike to save the riding history even when the ignition is turned off.',strong6: 'Race Telemetry', p8: 'The Race telemetry is a racing feature of the TVS Smart Connect which interprets the data collected during a race for the rider to use and analyze. It can help the rider to achieve optimum performance by showing them with stats what they need to improve and work on.', p9: 'Why settle for less when you can get the best. Upgrade to a smarter riding experience today with TVS SmartConnect.'},

    {ID: 'Women-on-bikes', p1: 'We often hear of women buying scooters, learning to ride it and getting a license for it. But how often do we hear of women trying out a motorbike, getting one and even riding it down the roads like a scooter? Rarely, isn’t it? Women on bikes is still something relatively new. Women have been expressing their interest towards bikes quite openly these days, but it is still a rare instance to see women embrace it and own it like they do scooters.',p2: 'As a woman myself, I used to feel that bikes are better suited for men as I had this pre-conceived notion that bikes are heavy and more difficult to master as there are more steps involved in operating it than a scooter.', p3: 'However, it took me experience and practice to understand that it isn’t actually very difficult to master. One of my friends, consistently insisted I learn how to ride a bike, but I wasn’t quite sure of myself. But he motivated, encouraged and taught me to ride it.', p4: 'Following this for my second ride, we took an off-road ride which was also quite pleasant despite my fear. And so, I had my third, fourth and other continued rides. Now, I feel like bikes are handier, more comfortable, and safer than scooters as bikes offer more control.', p5: 'Also, my perception of women on bikes has changed completely after my own experience. When I saw women on bikes earlier, they were a symbol of rebellion and freedom at once. But it isn’t so anymore. Now it just feels like another activity that anyone can take up regardless of whether they are men or women.', p6: 'After riding bikes, myself, I have begun seeing more women riding bikes on the road, something I didn’t notice or give a lot of attention to before. Also, after my own first-hand experience, I believe that we should approach things with an open mind. We should explore and dare to defy our own prejudiced ideas.', p7: 'It takes courage to take on a challenge and the joy that awaits after conquering the challenge is simply priceless but don’t choose your challenges and your rides based on just your gender. The idea of women on bikes should be just as normalized and simple as men on scooters.', p8: 'Dear women, you can be sensitive, yet you can be brave and take on a heavy bike with charm. Give it a shot, try it out. It doesn’t matter whether you choose to ride one down a road or not, because even if you don’t, you’ll still have learnt something new.'},

Jack Sparrow, Pirates of the Caribbean (On Stranger Tides)', p4: 'While I do not know if the above line was a quote by an actual person; Capt. Jack Sparrow himself, but the sentiment behind it is definitely real and it is even more true in the case of motorcycle road trips as we mostly do it for the thrill of riding the path rather than reaching the destination.' , p5: 'Among countless (actually, pretty countable) motorcycle trips I’ve had, the most memorable one is my trip to Mustang with my friends. A pretty mainstream destination, but one with some of the toughest roads in Nepal.' ,p6: 'I spent the journey as a pillion rider as I did not have my license then. While that did not make me much of a rider, I was able to enjoy everything else during my journey – the scenery, photos, videos and everything. Well, a perk being a pillion rider is that you get to travel along the mountain ranges while the guy at the handle focuses on the road. It is one of the few times you get to exclusively enjoy at the back seat!', p7: 'Our first day was actually quite uneventful. Like all Mustang journeys, ours started from Pokhara too. Our next destination was Tatopani – or it was where we hoped to get that day. We did make it, as somewhere along the way, it started to rain quite heavy. To make matters worse, we had no rain covers and two DSLRs. The downpour went on for over 2 hours, during which we had to side stop at a local tea shop, which was as booked as a flea market.', p8: 'There were over 100 people huddled close to the large stoves; drinking tea, or the local beverage. All of our destination – Mustang. Our vehicle- motorcycles. Everyone was skeptic of making it to Tatopani – or at least Beni Bazaar. But what was great about these riders, was that everyone wanted to make it and so we formed groups to share the journey together and mitigate the risks. It was a warm sense of brotherhood.', p9: 'You’re probably familiar with the numerous waterfalls and streams along the way to Mustang, and during monsoon, they overflow, rendering the path unable to cross, even for large vehicles – let alone bikes. And who’d have anticipated such heavy rains during the Dashain Tihar season? But there we were, all of us, caught in a storm – saved by these string of small tea shops, for now.', p10: ' We waited and waited but…the rain didn’t seem to stop, but it did slow down. Half of the crowd opted to stay huddled in the tea shop for the night as there was no point risking it. The other half of us headed out – at around 6 pm, uncertain about the way, but determined. The rough and slippery road challenged this forged “brotherhood” as eventually we weren’t travelling together as planned. Rather, the rain and the dark setting, made it each man for himself, situation. Very few of us had rain covers and nobody wanted to get wet.',p11: 'The rough road was slippery and as the only one with a waterproof jacket, I was carrying every one of our mobile phones. I did not know if the jacket was enough protection, but that was not the greatest concern, at all. It was making it across.', p12: 'After some 2 hours of slipping and sliding in the drizzling rain, we arrived at a spot where a small stream was overflowing like Trishuli itself. There was much hub-hub, and a large crowd of people trying to cross gathered there. I saw that our disbanded brotherhood had come together once again and we were connected with the spirit of helping one another cross the deadly river.', p13: 'The water levels were up to our waists and so, the bikes had to be ferried across by four people – two on each side pulling. Else, it would not make it. A guy tried getting his XR through single handedly – he fell, but was picked up by others in time. Water got inside his bike’s headlights, and his journey had come to a halt for the night.', p14: 'A taxi had been washed away downstream – the driver was safe, or so we heard. And a pickup truck was on the edge of the waterfall, stuck between a makeshift log bridge and a large rock – inches away from being washed. Bikers on both sides were helping each other cross, and once they made it across, they helped others. We had a scooter with us, which, 4 men carried above their heads and took it through.', p15: 'After that deadly crossing, we inched our way along the slippery road. None of the bikers had the courage to speed up, and most of the pillion riders, like me, were walking instead. Around 11 pm we made it to Tatopani and took a cold shower as we were so muddy and dirty.', p16: 'We couldn’t sleep that night though, as the only lodge we could find had bed bugs. At 6 in the morning, we were on our way. The next stop would be at Jomsom.', p17: 'Then, the next day, we were off to Muktinath.', p18: 'We faced many other troubles along the way, altitude, our engines refusing to carry us at the intended speed and so on. But we inched our way there and made it back too.',p19: 'In retrospect, I do not remember much of the destination. What I do remember is getting sore from sitting for too long and muddling through the flooding river with the spirit of brotherhood.', p20: 'Because of all that we faced during our trip; we have these stories to tell. The journey is now etched in my memory and it is a story of hardships, some bad luck, and a story of forged brotherhoods – though temporary.', p21: 'Captain Jack Sparrow was right after all.' },
    {ID: 'Tips-tricks-to-maintain-engine-in-winter', p1: "Professional bike mechanics and motorcycle riders alike have debated if motorcycles/ scooters should be started during the long cold winter months or while in storage. Most bikers agree, if done properly, it lubricates the inside of the engine. Others say no, that it can be harmful to the battery and may lead to condensation build-up inside the engine and exhaust. So, what's the best practice for starting your motorcycle/ scooter during winter?", p2: "I am NISCHAL SHRESTHA. I believe that it could be beneficial to start your motorcycle/ scooter on occasions provided it's done correctly. “Sometimes condensation may occur when a bike is started and let idle for a short period of time but does not reach the optimal temperature to eliminate moisture build-up. But if you’re unsure and don’t want to risk damage. Please schedule service for your bike”.", p3: "SAFETY TIP before you attempt any of these tips below, we recommend you do so in a properly ventilated area for your own personal safety.", p4: "Starting Motorcycle/ Scooter", p5: 'Step 1 – Starting the Motorcycle/ Scooter', p6: '  A battery tender will help protect your bike’s electrical system. Removing the battery is no longer necessary with newer models. However, always check with your manufacturer. Removal of the battery may also cause the loss and/or malfunction of saved electronic settings. Having your motorcycle on a tender allows you to quickly start your motorcycle/ scooter in winter without the hassle of connecting and disconnecting battery wires. A quick detachable plug is an ideal solution if you decide to transport your motorcycle.', p7: ' Motorcycle/ Scooter Running', p8: 'Step 2 – Letting Your Motorcycle/ Scooter Run', p9 : 'The best thing you can do for your motorcycle/scooter is to let it run so that it gets up to normal operating temperature. This may take up to 15 minutes depending on the year, make, and model. By not letting it warm up to the optimal temperature, you risk engine and exhaust condensation build-up, which may have critical consequences. Older motorcycles/ scooters are more susceptible to plug filing and carbon build up, and carburetor issues. The rule of thumb; let it run, heat up and evaporate the condensation through the exhaust system.', p10: 'Moving Motorcycle/ Scooter', p11: 'Step 3 – Move the Motorcycle/ Scooter', p12: '    When your motorcycle/ scooter sits idle during winter, gravity takes over and the oil pools to the bottom of the case and the gears at the top remains exposed. By moving the motorcycle, you can lubricate its internal parts and reduce the risk of oil starvation at start-up. However, if the roads are snow packed, icy or have salt residue, moving the bike around the inside of the garage should do the trick. Again, ensure your garage or storage area is properly ventilated to avoid inhalation of exhaust fumes.', p13: 'Check Tire Pressure', p14: 'Step 4 – Check the Air in Your Tires', p15: "Letting your motorcycle/ scooter sit for any period of time will allow air to escape from the tires.  The cold weather will often speed up the tire pressure loss process.  It's crucial that you maintain the proper tire pressure so that your tires don't develop flat spots from sitting in one location for too long.  We recommend, you visually inspect your bike tires for any worn tread and dry rot spots by manually rotating them and inspecting left, right and center of the tires.", p16: 'Check for Rust', p17: 'Step 5 – Inspect for Rust', p18: "Winter can be your bike’s chrome's greatest enemy, due to rust.  An affordable way to prevent rust from appearing is by spraying a generous amount of WD40 on the metal surfaces of your motorcycle.  As spring rolls around, simply clean off the oil with normal washing, just be sure to not get it on the fiberglass, seats, or windshield.", p19: 'Shutting off Gas', p20: 'Step 6 – Shutting off the Gas', p21: "The final step once you get your motorcycle/ scooter up to normal operating temperature, is to shut the fuel petcock off and let the bike run till it dies. The next time you start it, turn it over for 15 seconds or so to pump oil to the top-end of your motor before you turn the fuel on and fire up your motorcycle/ scooter.  This will keep the varnish from old evaporated gas from building up in your carburetor and keep the wear down in your engine's bearings and top end.", p22: "These 6 steps above will keep your motorcycle/ scooter in shape during its winter hibernation. If you don't want to start your motorcycle/ scooter over the winter, no need to panic, it’s perfectly fine to choose this option.  However, if you do choose to start up your motorcycle/ scooter in winter keep some of these tips in mind so you won't be doing any harm to your ride. Apply these tips and tricks for a more positive result this winter. "},
    {ID: 'Scooter-make-urban-commuting-easier', p1: "When I began working as a Marketing Representative at a pharmaceutical company. My work required me to visit different hospitals to attend doctor’s and pharmacy’s calls for order bookings. Initially, I didn't have any means of transport and was traveling by public transport. But the terrible traffic situation of Kathmandu made traveling by public vehicles very difficult as I had to travel for almost 3-4 hours daily. I was constantly tired and restless after attending each call.", p2: "I knew I had to get a scooter but since I wasn't familiar with automobiles and two-wheelers, I was confused about what to choose with regards to power, performance, and affordability. My brother is quite familiar with two-wheelers and so I approached him for his opinion.  His very first recommendation was TVS Ntorq 125. As an Apache owner, he was impressed with the performance and durability of TVS. However, I was still confused as there were so many other scooters in the market ", p3: 'that claimed to have a better resell value. So, my brother took me to a TVS showroom to show it to me for real. Firstly, I was blown away by its sporty looks. I had never seen a scooter with a full LCD and smart connect system before. It was impressive but I wasn’t entirely convinced yet. So, I took it for a test ride. After taking it for a spin and I was fully convinced with the performance of this machine. It also had other unique features like smart connect digital display, disc brake at the front, and an exhaust note along with a very comfortable seat.', p4: 'I now own a Ntorq and have been commuting with it for the last 3 months. Commuting around Kathmandu is now a whole new experience. My chaotic and hectic traveling days are over. I can now travel safely and comfortably. My Ntorq has a great performance and is quite easy to shuffle in traffic too. It has made urban commuting easier. Owning a TVS scooter has helped me perform my duties effectively and I am proud to say that I own one of the most powerful and sporty scooters in this segment.' },

Motorcycling is not a means of transport but an ideology, a nomadic way of life.” – Amit Reddy', p2: 'Ever since the invention of motorcycle, humans have taken it as a means for thrill and adventure rather than using it for daily use. Through the course of history, vintage bikes and bikers have explored the unseen lands and have left tire marks for future generations to follow. With the advent of social media and moto vlogging platforms, there has been a drastic surge in the number of motorcycle owners. Many are influenced by the ideology of venturing into new lands and are driven to describe the word Adventure on their own. The concept of bike rides originated from the West and slowly made its way to Nepal. Bike rides are an all-time high in Nepal which can be due to the diverse two-wheeler market and the spending capacity of people. It doesn’t matter whether people indulge in bike rides to make a name for themselves or to find tranquility, one thing we can all agree upon is that the feeling of riding a motorcycle is simply phenomenal.', p3: 'In terms of landscape and natural scenery, everything else pales in comparison to Nepal. This small Himalayan nation is home to some of the finest sceneries and roaring rivers. Blend the element of a motorbike in it and what you’re left with is riding alongside rivers while admiring sceneries of faraway mountains and picturesque hills. In this blog, we shall aim to take an inside look into places where you can enjoy your motorcycle to the fullest and become one with nature.', p4: '1. Kathmandu to Pokhara', p5: 'The road from Kathmandu to Pokhara is one of the most frequented one in Nepal. Although there are numerous riding destinations available, nothing captures the thrill and experience that this trip provides. The road takes you along the picturesque Prithivi Highway and goes through miniature settlements like Kurintar, Malekhu, and Damauli. The road is carved on hillsides and as you ride, you will witness the grandeur of the Trishuli river and the Marshyangdi river. The trip covers a distance of 200 km and on a motorbike, it can be completed in approximately 5-6 hours. It is recommended that you start early in the morning as the breeze is refreshing and invigorating. As this is a busy highway, you need to be very careful as there are minor setbacks too. This ride can be taken throughout the year. The roads are calling so why wait?', p6: '2. Kathmandu to Sindhuli', p7: 'Have you heard the song “Sindhuligadi ghumera herda?” If yes, then this bike trip will take you to the song’s origins. Touted by many as the most beautiful and conditioned highway in Nepal, the BP highway will be your road to reach the endpoint Sindhuli. From Kathmandu, you need to cover a distance of 134 km which will seem a bit less. However the ride’s quality is simply unparalleled. Traverse through the hairpin curve roads that dwindle the hills and valley and with each rev, you’ll be blessed with gorgeous sceneries of the hills, lively streams, and the constant hum of your motorcycle. This ride is relatively easy as the roads are in perfect condition and can be done throughout the year.', p8: '3. Mustang biking tour', p9: 'Mustang is a utopia for travelers. It may seem like a far-fetched claim but once you visit it, you’ll know that words don’t do justice to this natural enigma. This magical region enthralls travelers with its barren terrain, blissful lakes, and dazzling views of the delightful Annapurna mountain ranges. In terms of traveling, you might have seen the meme “Best friend sanga mustang jane thulo plan xa”. This biking trip will help you fulfill this wish. This trip spans over a total of 5 days and is completed in phases. This trip will be the ultimate test of your biking skills as you will have to ride through landslide-prone roads and waterfalls. The ride takes a quick break at Tatopani where you’ll relax the tired mind and soul in the hot springs. The penultimate point of this tour is the Muktinath temple which is a great religious hub for Hindus and Buddhists alike. This road is best explored from October to mid-December. After completing this tour, you’ll be left with a plethora of memories that you’ll cherish forever.', p10: '4. Kathmandu to Dolalghat', p11: 'This biking trip takes you along the Araniko highway and shows you the green hills and a surreal backdrop of nearby settlements. This biking trip is best suited for novice riders as it teaches them the do’s and don’ts on a highway. This short journey starts from Kathmandu and covers a distance of 58 km. The road is paved most of the way so you won’t face any problems except the heavy vehicles. After arriving at Dolalghat, take a moment to relax by observing the rushing Bhote Koshi river and dine on the delightful fried fishes.', p12: '5. Kathmandu to Tatopani', p13: 'This is an extended version of the Kathmandu-Dolalghat trip and it will take you to the border of Tibet, Tatopani. You will take the Araniko highway which will later join the Kathmandu-Kodari highway. The journey is a blend of numerous ups and downs and you will be greeted with small settlements along the way. The road clings to a hill and as you proceed, you’ll be blessed with picturesque Himalayan panorama. The distance covered in this trip is 115 km and you can witness hydropower projects and Chinese equipments here. The road is steep and difficult here so take caution. Finally, you’ll arrive at Tatopani where the strong winds might topple you. Bathe in the hot springs as the water there, are believed to possess healing properties. Nothing beats the experience of relaxing in a hot spring with a chilled beer!', p14: 'There are numerous biking routes in Nepal which you can use to go on a bike ride but these are the must-visit ones.

After a regular ride, have you noticed how cleaning your bike improves its performance and gives your machine that vivid look?', p2: 'The roads in Nepal are dusty, dirty and have crazy potholes everywhere. It gets worse in monsoon and rainy seasons as all of it turns into a muddy mess. When the dirt and mud get onto the bike, it increases the weight of the bike which interferes in the smooth running of the machine and causes a loss of performance due to the mud getting into the drive chains, disc pads, and other crucial parts.', p3: "Motorcycles have less surface and bodywork area.

To do this, get your motorcycle to rest on its paddock or center stand and put the gear on neutral. Roll the wheel slowly and apply WD- 40 or degreasing spray throughout the chain. Next, clean it with an old toothbrush (chain cleaner preferred) including the chains’ sides as well as the chain sprockets. Water the bike to loosen the dirt or debris. If you have a pressure cleaner, you can put gentle pressure on the bodyworks and concentrate more on areas that attract dirt such as the mudguard and the bike, its sides along with the bottom of the engine. After the bike is wet, use an old toothbrush to clean around the tight places in the engine area. Ensure that pressure is not used while removing the dirt as it may remove paint in the engine area. If there is stubborn dirt, use the degreasing spray. Once the engine area is clean, move on to the wheels and other tight places.', strong3: 'Body', p6: 'Rinse the motorcycle with cool water. Make sure to rinse starting from the top of the bike and slowly go down. After you have rinsed the upper body part, go directly to the mudguard as it will have a lot of dirt under it. If you are using a pressure cleaner or hose, make sure the pressure is gentle and the spray isn’t concentrated. Be careful not to pressure wash in wired areas or fuse box. Use any auto detergent shampoo and mix the solution with water in a bucket. Dip the sponge or microfiber cloth in the painted bodyworks starting from the top of the bike. Make sure you have a separate cloth for non- painted surfaces as dirt stuck on it can damage painted surfaces.', p7: 'Rinse as soon as you are done and make sure that the shampoo solution doesn’t dry or sit idle for a long time. Once it has been washed away, use a clean dry chamois or microfiber cloth to wipe away remaining water. Make sure the water is all dried up to avoid stains. Also, wait for the water to dry up as a wet bike is more likely to attract dirt and leave stains.', strong4: ' After Wash', p8: 'After you have removed all dirt, lubricate the chain with proper chain lube. After lubricating the chain, apply detailing products on all painted bodyworks surface. Avoid applying on the seat, handlebar controls, brake levers, gear levers, and tires, as it will make those surfaces slippery. Make sure to not use dirty water or cloths. Also, if your motorcycle has only attracted a little dust, simply wipe it away with a microfiber cloth. Likewise, do not keep your motorcycle under direct sunlight for long as it may oxidize your paint.' }
